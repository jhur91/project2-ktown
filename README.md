# Ktown Finder
### This is a game in which you need to identify the secret word. You will check to see which letters fill in the blanks until you fill them all up to fully reveal the secret word.  You may make up to 6 incorrect guesses. Upon the 6th incorrect guess, the game will end and you will have lost. If you correctly identify the secret word without using up the incorrect guesses, you will have won.  The number of incorrect guesses are represented by a body piece to our hangman, a person-like figure that will develop as incorrect guesses are played. When all incorrect guesses have been used, the hangman will have all parts to its body.

# Next Steps
### Moving forward, I plan on adding categories to choose from, such as "sports" or "foods" so that users can have a choice for what type of words they want to play with.  I also plan on adding music and improving the css so that the hangman looks more humanlike.
